Please visit \\n\\nwww.amazon.com/devicesupport for more information about specific features. \\n\\nSetting up your Kindle \\n\\nSetting up your Kindle takes a few simple steps: \\n\\n Select the device language. \\n\\n Connect to a wireless network. \\n\\n Register your Kindle to your Amazon account. \\n\\n Link your Kindle to your social network accounts. (Optional) \\n\\nIf you haven't done these steps yet, go to the Home screen now, select Set Up Your \\n\\nKindle, and follow the onscreen prompts. If you bought your Kindle online using your \\n\\nAmazon account, it is already registered to you. To verify, tap the Home icon and look \\n\\nfor your Amazon user name in the upper left corner of the Home screen. If it says My \\n\\nKindle or shows the name of a previous owner instead of your own Amazon account \\n\\nname, you'll need to register it.  \\n\\nTo register a Kindle that has been previously registered, tap the Quick Actions icon on \\n\\nthe toolbar, then tap All Settings. On the Settings page, tap My Account, then \\n\\nRegister/Deregister Device. If you have enabled Sign in Approval, you will need to \\n\\nenter your passcode followed by the security code sent to your phone when you \\n\\nregister the device. \\n\\nIf you have difficulty connecting to your wireless network or need more information, \\n\\nsee Network Connectivity. Once you have completed the setup process, Set Up Your \\n\\nKindle will no longer appear on your Home screen. \\n\\nKeyboard \\n\\nYour Kindle has an onscreen keyboard.

Tap the word you want to \\n\\nselect. \\n\\nChapter 2 Navigating Your Kindle \\n\\nYour Kindle features a touchscreen interface that enables you to perform many tasks \\n\\nwith just a tap or swipe of a finger. To select an item, simply tap it. For example, tap a \\n\\nbook cover or title to open the book, or tap the Menu icon on the item's cover to \\n\\nview available options. \\n\\nTap zones \\n\\nThe EasyReach feature of your Kindle lets you effortlessly turn pages in a book or \\n\\nperiodical while holding the device with just one hand. Tapping almost anywhere in \\n\\nthe display area will take you to the next page; the area is large enough to be tapped \\n\\nwhether you hold the device with your left or right hand. Tap the left side of the \\n\\nscreen to go to the previous page. The EasyReach tap zones differ depending on \\n\\nwhether your Kindle is in portrait or landscape mode. When reading , you can change \\n\\nthe screen orientation by tapping the Menu icon and selecting Portrait or Landscape \\n\\nMode.
